Few words from Mollie: Our mission is to create a greater playing field for everyone. By offering convenient, safe world-wide payment solutions we remove barriers so you could focus on growing your business. Being authentic is our baseline.

Mollie is one of Europe's fastest-growing fin-tech companies. We provide a simple payment API, that enables webshop and app builders to implement more than twenty different payment methods in one go. Our packages and plugins are completely open-source, freely available, and easy to integrate into your current project.

Mollie thrives on innovation. When we started we spearheaded the payments industry by introducing effortless payment products that were easier, cheaper, and more flexible than what the rigid, cumbersome banks could do. Now, more than a decade later, trusted by 70.000+ businesses, Mollie is still building innovative products and working hard to make payments better.

# Installation
----

### Requirements

We work on stable, supported and up-to-date versions of packages. We recommend you to do the same.

| Package | Version |
| --- | --- |
| PHP |  ^7.2 |
| ext-json: * |  |
| mollie/mollie-api-php |  ^2.0 |
| sylius/admin-order-creation-plugin |  ^0.9.0 |
| sylius/refund-plugin |  ^1.0.0-RC.3 |
| sylius/sylius |  ^1.7.0 |

----


For the full installation guide please go to [installation](doc/installation.md)

## Usage
----
During configuration first, save the keys to the database and then click "Load methods"

### Rendering Mollie credit card form

You can use `BitBagSyliusMolliePlugin:DirectDebit:_form.html.twig` and `@BitBagSyliusMolliePlugin/Grid/Action/cancelSubscriptionMollie.html.twig` templates for adding the form to supplementing the direct debit card data from and cancel the subscription form the Twig UI.

For an example on how to do that, take a look at [these source files](tests/Application/templates/bundles/SyliusShopBundle).

## Customization
----
##### You can [decorate](https://symfony.com/doc/current/service_container/service_decoration.html) available services and [extend](https://symfony.com/doc/current/form/create_form_type_extension.html) current forms.

Run the below command to see what Symfony services are shared with this plugin:

```
$ bin/console debug:container bitbag_sylius_mollie_plugin
```

## Recurring subscription
----
### State Machine

For a better integration with Mollie's recurring subscription, [you can use state machine callback.](http://docs.sylius.com/en/1.1/customization/state_machine.html#how-to-add-a-new-callback)

Available states:

* Processing: Subscription created but not active yet (startdate higher than "now")
* Active: Subscription is in progress. Not all payments are done, but we wait until the next payment date
* Cancelled: The merchant cancelled the subscription
* Suspended: Mandates became invalid, so the subscription is suspended
* Completed: All subscription payments are executed according to the timetable

## Plugin Development
----
### Instalation
```
$ composer install
$ cd tests/Application
$ yarn install
$ yarn encore dev
$ bin/console assets:install -e test
$ bin/console doctrine:database:create -e test
$ bin/console doctrine:schema:create -e test
$ symfony server:start
$ open http://localhost:8080 // or the port showed in your terminal while runing command with symfony server:start
```

* Also in tests/Application/config/packages/webpack_encore.yaml, make sure there is such configuration:

```
webpack_encore:
    output_path: '%kernel.project_dir%/public/build/default'
    builds:
        mollie-admin: '%kernel.project_dir%/public/build/mollie-admin'
        mollie-shop: '%kernel.project_dir%/public/build/mollie-shop'
```

* Also make sure you have such configuration in your shop and admin views directory:

```Shop directory: 
in: src/Resources/views/Shop/_javascripts.html.twig:
<script src="https://js.mollie.com/v1/mollie.js"></script>
{{ encore_entry_script_tags('shop-entry', null, 'mollie-shop') }}
{{ encore_entry_script_tags('plugin-shop-entry', null, 'mollie-shop') }}

in: src/Resources/views/Shop/_stylesheets.html.twig:
{{ encore_entry_link_tags('shop-entry', null, 'mollie-shop') }}
{{ encore_entry_link_tags('plugin-shop-entry', null, 'mollie-shop') }}
```
```Admin directory: 
in: src/Resources/views/Admin/_javascripts.html.twig:
{{ encore_entry_script_tags('admin-entry', null, 'mollie-admin') }}
{{ encore_entry_script_tags('plugin-admin-entry', null, 'mollie-admin') }}

in: src/Resources/views/Admin/_stylesheets.html.twig:
{{ encore_entry_link_tags('admin-entry', null, 'mollie-admin') }}
{{ encore_entry_link_tags('plugin-admin-entry', null, 'mollie-admin') }}

```


### Frontend

#### Starting server and building assets

* Go to `./tests/Application/` directory
* Run `symfony server:start` in terminal. It will start local server.
* Run `yarn watch` in terminal. It will watch your changes in admin and shop catalogs: 
  `../../src/Resources/assets/admin/..`, `../../src/Resources/assets/shop/..`
* Run `yarn dev` in terminal to build your assets once in development mode.
* Run `yarn encore production` in terminal, to build your assets once in production mode - its required before creating every Pull Request.
* All assets (mollie assets + sylius base assets) will be build in:
```
tests/application/public/build/mollie-admin/..
tests/application/public/build/mollie-shop/..
```


#### Rebuilding assets in your root/SRC directory

* `bin/console assets:install`


#### CSS & JS files directory you can edit and work with:

* Admin: go to `./src/Resources/assets/admin/**/`
* Shop: go to `./src/Resources/assets/shop/**/`
