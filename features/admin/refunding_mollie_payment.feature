        And the store has a product "Green Arrow"
        And the store ships everywhere for free
        And the store allows paying offline
        And the store has a payment method "Mollie" with a code "mollie" and Mollie payment gateway
        And there is a customer "oliver@teamarrow.com" that placed an order "#00000001"
