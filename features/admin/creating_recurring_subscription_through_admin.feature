Feature: Creating order through admin with Mollie Subscription payment
  In order to place order in the name of a Customer and forward the payment to them
  As an Administrator
  I want to be able to create an order with Mollie Subscription payment in Admin panel

  Background:
    Given the store operates on a single channel in "United States"
    And the store has a product "Stark Coat" priced at "$100"
    And the store has a product "Lannister Banner" priced at "$40"
    And the store ships everywhere for free
    And the store has a payment method "Mollie Subscription" with a code "mollie_subscription" and Mollie Subscription payment gateway
    And there is a customer account "mail@example.com"
    And I am logged in as an administrator

  @ui @javascript
  Scenario: Creating an order with Mollie Subscription payment for an existing customer
    When I create a new order for "mail@example.com" and channel "United States"
    And I add "Stark Coat" to this order
    And I specify this order shipping address as "Ankh Morpork", "Frost Alley", "90210", "United States" for "Jon Snow"
    And I select "Mollie Subscription" payment method
    And I place and confirm this order
    Then I should be notified that order has been successfully created
    And there should be one not paid nor shipped order with channel "United States" for "mail@example.com" in the registry
    When I view summary of last order
    Then it should be paid with "Mollie Subscription"
