    And the store has a product "Angel T-Shirt"
    And the store ships everywhere for free
    And I am logged in as an administrator
    And the store has a payment method "Mollie Subscription" with a code "mollie_subscription" and Mollie Subscription payment gateway

    And I chose "Free" shipping method with "Mollie Subscription" payment
    And this order is already paid
    And this order has an active mollie subscription
    And this subscription has an active schedule
